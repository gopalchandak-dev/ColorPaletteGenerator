# Generate Color Palette

A simple color palette generator built with React. This application allows users to create random color palettes, copy color hex codes to the clipboard, and lock specific colors when generating new palettes.

I created this project as part of my learning journey with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**. It helped me better understand how to manage state, work with reusable components, and apply utility-first styling.ðŸ“œðŸš€

## Features

- **Generate Random Palettes**: Click a button to generate a new palette of random colors.
- **Copy Colors**: Click on any color box to copy the hex code to your clipboard.
- **Lock Colors**: Lock individual colors to prevent them from changing when generating new palettes.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive, built using Tailwind CSS.
